/*
We are given a "tree" in the form of a 2D-array, with distinct values for each node.

In the given 2D-array, each element pair [u, v] represents that v is a child of u in the tree.

We can remove exactly one redundant pair in this "tree" to make the result a tree.

You need to find and output such a pair. If there are multiple answers for this question, output the one appearing last in the 2D-array. There is always at least one answer.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: Original tree will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [3,1]]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: Original tree will be like this:
  1
 / \\
2   3
Note:
The size of the input 2D-array will be between 1 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and 2000.
