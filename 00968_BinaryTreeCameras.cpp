/*
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

Example 1:

     x
     C
  x     x   

Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Example 2:
       x
      c
     x
    c
      x

Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
Every node has value 0.
